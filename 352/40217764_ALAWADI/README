After testing, we have observed that the linear recursion is more efficient since it has a time complexity
of O(n) and that it calculates the oddonacci numbers by summing the preceeding three numbers which is very
helpful in avoiding redundant calculations. Adding more inputs doesn't impact it much. However, the multiple recursion
is a problem because it has a bottleneck, that it tends to recalculate numbers again which causes the time 
complexity to become exponential or O(n^3) and therefore the runtime becomes very long.
Even when comparing the test results, we notice that the numbers for multiple recursion are much bigger than the linear ones.
